# Set theory

## Union:
Let A and B be sets. The union of the sets A and B, denoted by `A ∪ B`, is the set that contains those elements that are either in A or in B, or in both.
> A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B}.
>
> A = {1, 3, 5} ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 5}.

## Intersection
The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by `A ∩ B`, is the set containing those elements in both A and B.
> A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B}
>
> {1, 3, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 3}.

## Disjoint
Two sets are called disjoint if their intersection is the empty set.

> Let A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. Because A ∩ B = ∅ 

## Difference
The difference of A and B, denoted by A − B, is the set containing those elements **that are in A but not in B**. 

> A − B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x / ∈ B}.
>
> {1, 3, 5} − {1, 2, 3} = {5}

#### Universal set
Let U be the universal set. The complement of the set A, denoted by A, is the complement
of A with respect to U. Therefore, the complement of the set A is U − 

> negation -A = {x ∈ U | x / ∈ A}.

Example: 
> Let A = {a, e, i, o, u} . Then negation -A = {b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z}.
